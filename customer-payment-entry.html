If there is more than one branch/location for this customer, select the correct one from the second combo-box.</li><li>Select the bank account the deposit should be made to. List of <a href="./bank-accounts.html">Bank Accounts</a> can be setup in <em>Banking and General Ledger</em> module.</li><li>If needed, change the date of the deposit.</li><li>Enter the full amount of any additional bank charges (NSF charge, Cheque certification, etc).</li><li>Enter the discount taken by the customer (the discount they are qualified to take will be shown above this line).</li><li>Enter the full amount of the deposit.</li><li>Optionally, enter a memo/note about the deposit. This may be something as simple as the type of payment(VISA/Mastercard/Direct Deposit/Cheque/etc.) or cheque number.</li></ol><p class="vspace">In order to apply this payment to individual invoices, you must select <a href="./allocate-customer-payments-or-credit-notes.html">Allocate Customer Payments or Credit Notes</a> from the Sales tab, after you have finished entering payments.</p><h3>Tips and Tricks</h3><ul><li>A reference number will be generated automatically. It is not, typically, a good idea to change/set this number manually.</li><li>Exchange rates are applied automatically. If the wrong exchange rate is listed, you may need to adjust the following:<ol><li>Setup Tab-&gt;<a href="./company-setup.html">Company Setup</a> - Set the correct currency for your company/country.</li><li>Sales Tab-&gt;<a href="./add-and-manage-customers.html">Add and Manage Customers</a> - Set the correct currency for your customer.</li><li>Banking and General Ledger Tab-&gt;<a href="./exchange-rates.html">Exchange Rates</a> - Set/Update the correct exchange rate for the currency in question.</li></ol></li><li>A/R and customer record with foreign currency<ol><li>If you use the Sales | Customer Payments method it works correctly.</li><li>However, if you process a Bank | Deposit, then Sales | Customer Allocation the customer allocation process does not process the foreign currency difference correctly (it gets it backward, and doesn't take the difference between the settled amount and the original invoice amount in AR).</li><li>Bank Deposit Entry is for receiving a customer payment.</li><li>Bank Payment Entry is for paying a supplier.</li></ol></li></ul><div class="vspace"> </div><h3>Bad debtors</h3><p>From time to time you may experience a bad debtor, not settling his payment. Before you can write him off, your local legislations may require that you make legal effort to collect his money. However, we got a good suggestion from Rod Webster on how to handle a bad debtor when nothing else had helped:</p><ol><li>Create a service item f.i. 'Bad Debtor' with no price in Items.</li><li>Use the same Item Tax Type as you used originally against the debtor.</li><li>Make a free Credit Note to this debtor using the service item 'Bad Debtor'. Set the price to the same as the sub-total in the original invoice. Use write off items. You don't have to send it to the debtor. He is probably already bankrupcy.</li><li>This will handle all GL transactions in a correct way and the tax will be counter-booked.</li></ol><div class="vspace"> </div><h3>Prepayment</h3><ol><li>Forum Post</li><li>If the Payment Terms is set to be of type pre payment, then the days is set internally to -1.</li><li>This will display a due date to be the document day - 1. This is ok.</li><li>This way it is easy to see that the payment terms is pre payment.</li></ol><div class="vspace"> </div><h3>Prepayment in 2.4</h3><ol><li>This is incomplete and possibly inaccurate, but given that I can find nothing else, hopefully this gives others a place to start. please fine tune it...<ol><li>Under Setup=&gt;Payment Terms, there must be a payment option with type Prepayment</li><li>When creating a sales order:<ol><li>at the top set payment to be your prepayment option</li><li>at the bottom, fill the value of the prepayment in the Pre-Payment Required field</li></ol></li><li>Go to sales=&gt;Invoice prepaid orders:<ol><li>on the right will be an option to create prepayment invoice</li><li>at the top set your payment terms to be your prepayment option</li><li>at the bottom, it should show your prepayment as being invoiced here, and the amount left to be invoiced</li></ol></li><li>Some other steps that I can't quite sort out<ol><li>payment needs to be entered</li><li>Delivery against sales order must be processed</li></ol></li><li>Go to sales=&gt;Invoice prepaid orders:<ol><li>You should have an option to create the final invoice now</li><li>at the top, select the normal payment method.<ol><li>in my case, the previous payments were not shown on the screen, but the prepayment was shown on the invoice, and the correct value is displayed in the customer payments page.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><div class="vspace"> </div><h3>Bounced Cheques</h3><p>Bounced cheques are one of the most common offences plague the monetary world. You please present the cheque again and on receipt of the information about the bounce of the cheque you instantly issue notice within 30 days from the receipt of the information of bounce of the cheque to the client.</p><ul><li>Forum Post</li><li>If nothing appears on Bank Statement then just cancel the payment in FA.</li><li>If both transaction (the payment and the bouncing) appear on your statement:<ul><li>First make a payment (General Ledger/Payment) and chose customer (in <strong>Pay to</strong>) - First trick<ul><li>Enter the date when the check bounced.</li><li>Need to probably use the normal Debtor account.</li></ul></li><li>Now, deallocate the bounced payment from the invoice and reallocate it to your payment.<ul><li>Go to <strong>Customer allocation</strong></li><li>Tick the <strong>show settle allocation</strong> box. You should see the bounced payment - Second trick</li><li>Reallocate it (press the bank notes icon).</li><li>Change the amount allocated to the invoice to 0 (or press None)</li><li>Allocate it to YOUR payment (your payment should appear as allocatable as other invoices) - Third trick</li><li>Press Ok</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="./" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><a href="./working-with-flow-accounting.html" target="_self" aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Working with Flow acounting</a><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="./demo-3.html" target="_self">Sales</a></li><li><a href="./purchases.html" target="_self">Purchases</a></li><li><a href="./items-and-inventory.html" target="_self">Items and Inventory</a></li><li><a href="./manufacturing.html" target="_self">Manufacturing</a></li><li><a href="./fixed-assets.html" target="_self">Fixed Assets</a></li><li><a href="./dimensions.html" target="_self">Dimensions</a></li><li><a href="./banking-and-general-ledger.html" target="_self">Banking And General Ledger</a></li><li><a href="./setup.html" target="_self">Setup</a></li><li><a href="./purchases.html" target="_self">Purchases</a></li></ul></li><li class="has-submenu"><a href="./the-superadmin.html" target="_self" aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">The Super Admin</a><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="./createupdate-companies-installupdate-languages-installactivate-extensions-software-upgrade.html" target="_self">Create/Update Companies, Install/Update Languages, Install/Activate Extensions, Software Upgrade</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p><br>If you require help using the software or have any questions, our support team is here to assist you.
