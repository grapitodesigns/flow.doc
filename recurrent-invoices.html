Imagine you have 100 customers that need a monthly rental invoice. By using Recurrent Invoices you only have to press a button to send them by email or print them out.</p><p class="vspace">There are two ways of using recurrent invoices. You can either select a group or a single customer/branch.</p><p class="vspace">If you are going to use groups, start by creating the groups you will put on the branches, e.g. Large, Medium and Small</p><p class="vspace">Go into the branches, Sales &gt; Maintenance &gt; Customer Branches, locate the customer, set the appropriate Sales Group and update the branch.</p><p class="vspace">This Forum Post discusses Recurring Invoices from v2.1 onwards.</p><div class="vspace"> </div><h3>Procedure</h3><p>You are now ready to make some recurrent invoice definitions by clicking <strong><em>Recurrent Invoices</em></strong> in the <strong><em>Sales</em></strong> tab, <strong><em>Maintenance</em></strong> section</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="./media/posts/81/gallery/Help.recurrent.png" data-size="600x232"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/81/gallery/Help.recurrent-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="600" height="232"></a></figure></div></div><p class="vspace">The recurrent invoices use the Template Orders, that are shown under Template Delivery/Template Invoice in the <strong><em>Sales</em></strong> tab, <strong><em>Transactions</em></strong> section.</p><p class="vspace">Template Orders are based on issued invoices, so you have to set up and send out an invoice before you can mark it as a template.</p><p class="vspace">First enter a Description of the item. Select the appropriate template. If this should be addressed to a single customer/branch, select a customer and a branch. If it should be based on a group, leave the customer empty and select the group to which you want to send the recurrent invoices.</p><p class="vspace">Now it is time to consider the interval of the invoicing. If you select days and set the monthly value to 0, it will be due every x days. If you select a monthly value, it will be due on an x monthly interval. <del>-and if you select a days value it will be due on that day in the month-</del>. From Release 2.3.5 you choose the day value by setting the actual beginning date. You can change existing recurrent invoices by changing the Last Sent day. A days value of -1 together with a month value would be the last day in the previous month. A monthly value of 3 indicated a due every quarter and 12 every year and so on.</p><p class="vspace">The begin date is the date to start sending the recurrent invoice and the end date when to stop sending the invoices.</p><div class="vspace"> </div><h3>Create and print the recurrent invoices</h3><p>Before creating recurring invoices, check that the price factor in company setup is set. Also check that a sales prices are set in the item sales prices. It must not be zero. If you have foreign customers the price is automatically calculated. Go to <a href="./create-and-print-recurrent-invoices.html">Create And Print Recurrent Invoices</a> in the <strong><em>Sales</em></strong> tab, <strong><em>Transactions</em></strong> section. The due items are marked and a link <strong><em>Create invoices</em></strong> will be there. Pressing this link creates all the invoices belonging to this group or single customer/branch. An info line tells you how many invoice-numbers that have been created along with links to print or email the invoices.</p><div class="vspace"> </div><h3>Tips and Tricks</h3><p>If you need more than one group for a customer, create additional branches each with the required group. In order to easily identify this call the branch something similar to the group.</p></div></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="./" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><a href="./working-with-flow-accounting.html" target="_self" aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Working with Flow acounting</a><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="./demo-3.html" target="_self">Sales</a></li><li><a href="./purchases.html" target="_self">Purchases</a></li><li><a href="./items-and-inventory.html" target="_self">Items and Inventory</a></li><li><a href="./manufacturing.html" target="_self">Manufacturing</a></li><li><a href="./fixed-assets.html" target="_self">Fixed Assets</a></li><li><a href="./dimensions.html" target="_self">Dimensions</a></li><li><a href="./banking-and-general-ledger.html" target="_self">Banking And General Ledger</a></li><li><a href="./setup.html" target="_self">Setup</a></li><li><a href="./purchases.html" target="_self">Purchases</a></li></ul></li><li class="has-submenu"><a href="./the-superadmin.html" target="_self" aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">The Super Admin</a><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="./createupdate-companies-installupdate-languages-installactivate-extensions-software-upgrade.html" target="_self">Create/Update Companies, Install/Update Languages, Install/Activate Extensions, Software Upgrade</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Need Assistance or Support?<br><br>If you require help using the software or have any questions, our support team is here to assist you.
