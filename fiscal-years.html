A country's legal authority have various rules about how these <strong>Fiscal Years</strong> should be setup. A <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> often follow a normal Calendar Year, Jan 01 - Dec 31. But it could also be a broken year, f.i. Jul 01 - Jun 30. Many countries allow you to have an initial prolonged year, f.i. Jul 01 2009 - Dec 31 2010.</p><div class="vspace"> </div><h3>Procedure</h3><p>Note that you create a new <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> by selecting Setup tab, <a class="selflink" href="https://frontaccounting.com/fawiki/index.php?n=Help.FiscalYears">Fiscal Years</a> (you also close a <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> here) and you set the active <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> by selecting Setup tab, <a href="./company-setup.html">Company Setup.</a></p><p class="vspace">When you start a new Company, you should check that the <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> is setup correctly. If this is not your starting <strong>Fiscal Year</strong>, then you should start by creating the starting <strong>Fiscal Year</strong>. After you have corrected the starting <strong>Fiscal Year</strong>, you can delete other <strong>Fiscal Years</strong> if there are no transactions in them. Now set this new <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> on your company by selecting Setup tab, <a href="./company-setup.html">Company Setup.</a></p><p class="vspace">If the first year is setup as Jan 01 2011 - Dec 31 2011 and your starting Fiscal Year should be Jul 01 2011 - Jun 30 2012:</p><ul><li>Create a short dummy year, Jan 01 2012 - Jun 30 2012</li><li>Create another Year Jul 01 2012 - Jun 30 2013</li><li>Set the company to use this year</li><li>Close and delete the year Jan 01 2011 - Dec 31 2011</li><li>Close and delete the short dummy year Jan 01 2012 - Jun 30 2012</li><li>Create the correct broken <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> Jul 01 2011 - Jun 30 2012</li><li>Set this <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> Jul 01 2011 - Jun 30 2012 as active for the company</li></ul><p>You are now ready to make your transactions. You have 2 fiscal years and you are using the current (Jul 01 2011 - Jun 30 2012) one, whilst the later one (Jul 01 2012 - Jun 30 2013) is not current.</p><div class="vspace"> </div><ul><li>When you reach the end of your <strong>Fiscal Year</strong>, you have to create another new <strong>Fiscal Year</strong>.</li><li>When you want to switch <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> on your company, go into company setup and do that.</li><li>You will now be able to post to the current or past year:<ul><li>Your document numbers will increase irrespective of the fiscal year you process in.</li><li>Change the process date to be in the correct fiscal year.</li></ul></li><li>When you have finished your year-end entries, you may close the <strong>Fiscal Year</strong>.</li><li>A closed <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> can no longer be used for entries.</li><li>When a <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> is closed, the difference between all asset and liability accounts are brought forward as a Journal Entry where the Default account for <em>Retained Earnings</em> is credited if this is a profit and debited if there is a loss. And the default account for <em>Profit/Loss Year</em> is debited if this is a profit, and credited if there is a loss).</li></ul><p class="vspace">You can have as many <strong>Fiscal Years</strong> running as you want, but for performance reasons you should not have more than needed (by your legislations). When you delete a <strong>Fiscal Year</strong>, the assets, liabilities and equities are brought forward. All other unneeded transactions such as documents are deleted.</p><h3>Tips and Tricks</h3><p>In a newly setup company, we can change the fiscal year in the table <strong>X_fiscal_year</strong> where X is the company index number in the array <strong>$db_connections</strong> in the <strong>config_db.php</strong>. This can be done using any MySQL client like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/" rel="nofollow">phpMyAdmin</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.webyog.com/" rel="nofollow">SQLyog</a>, etc.,.</p><div class="vspace"> </div><h4>Deleting a Fiscal Year - <a class="urllink" href="https://frontaccounting.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=37519#p37519" rel="nofollow">Forum Post</a></h4><p>This is what happens when we delete a Fiscal Year:</p><div class="vspace"> </div><ol><li>Backup is done</li><li>All sales orders and details, up to last date, that are fully delivered are removed.
